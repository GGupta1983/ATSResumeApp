# GenAI-Powered ATS System Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for a next-generation Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that leverages Generative AI to intelligently match candidates with job opportunities. Unlike traditional keyword-based matching systems, our approach uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand candidate profiles contextually and match them based on potential, trajectory, and holistic fit.

## Vision Statement

**"Transform talent acquisition from keyword matching to intelligent understanding"**

We aim to build an ATS that understands:
- **Who the candidate really is** (beyond skill tags)
- **What they're capable of achieving** (based on track record and potential)
- **How they might fit** into specific team dynamics and challenges
- **Their growth trajectory** and career aspirations
